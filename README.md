# AWS UTILS

This repository contains small utilities that can be deployed into Amazon Web Services. I have built these utilities for myself for specific use cases.

These utilities are posted entirely as-is. You are free to use them for your own workflows. In doing so you assume all responsible for any costs incurred and any damage done to your data or infrastructure. They deploy real resources in the cloud, and you will be charged accordingly. I do not claim they implement best practices. However they are small enough that it is unlikely you will get in any real trouble. 

All utilities are written using the AWS Cloud Development Kit to be deployed with the AWS CLI. See individual folders for more information.

Current utilities:

- [S3 Test Data](tree/main/s3_test_data): Store test data for Github Actions in S3, with replacement and cache invalidation.
